### **Project Summary: Redesign of Ascent Physiotherapy Website**  
**Current Website URL**: [https://ascentphysiotherapy.com/](https://ascentphysiotherapy.com/)  

---

### **Why the Client Needs a New Website**  
1. **Outdated Design**: The existing design is not modern or visually appealing.  
2. **Limited Accessibility**: The current site does not fully comply with accessibility standards (e.g., lack of proper text alternatives, keyboard navigation issues).  
3. **Suboptimal Speed**: Slow loading time can frustrate users which can lower the web traffic.  
4. **Lack of Responsiveness**: The site does not perform well on various devices and screen sizes, making it hard for mobile users to navigate.  
  

---

### **Most Important Purpose of the Website**  
The primary purpose of the website is to:  
- Provide a seamless way to book appointments online or inquire about services.  
- Provide the information about all services and facilities. Addition to that, they also provide external web links and contact information.
---

### **Target Audience**  
The target audience includes:  
1. **Individuals**: People with injuries, chronic pain, or rehabilitation needs.  
2. **Athletes**: Those requiring specialized sports physiotherapy.  
3. **Elderly Clients**: Individuals needing therapy for mobility or age-related issues.  

---

### **Overall Message to Convey**  
The website should convey:  
- Professionalism and trustworthiness.  
- Expertise in physiotherapy and personalized care.  
- Accessibility and convenience in booking services.  

**Desired Actions from Visitors:**  
 I want the users to schedule an appointment online by clicking on book now option.On top of that, Contact the clinic for inquiries, read educational blog content, or get aware about provided products and services.

### **Why the Current Site is Not Appropriate**  
1. **Accessibility Issues**:  
   - Missing alt text for images and poor color contrast ratios, making it difficult for visually impaired users. 
   
2. **Performance and Speed**:  
   - The current site has slow loading speeds.

3. **Design Limitations**:  
   - The layout is cluttered, with no clear visual hierarchy.  
   - Limited use of modern design trends, which impacts engagement.  

4. **Responsiveness**:  
   - The site does not adapt well to mobile or tablet screens, leading to a poor user experience on smaller devices.  

5. **Content Presentation**:  
   - Important content, like services and booking, is not prominently displayed.  
   - Lack of engaging content like testimonials, case studies, or interactive features.

### **2. Look and Feel**

### **Mood**  
The website will convey the following visual mood:  
- **Clean and Professional**: The design will focus on clarity, trustworthiness, and professionalism. It will have a simple, structured layout with ample white space, making the content easy to navigate and ensuring that visitors can find the information they need quickly. This approach is ideal for a healthcare-related website where reliability and expertise are key.
